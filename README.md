Random ChangePoint Models

This R package proposes different functions to make inference on a random changepoint framework for longitudinal data. The work is still in progress and the package is not yet fully functional. Already implemented or being implemented are :
* testRCPMM: a test for the existence of a random changepoint for longitudinal data
* rcpme: an estimation algorithm for random changepoint mixed models
* bircpme: an estimation algorithm for bivariate random changepoint mixed models taking into account an eventual correlation between two markers
